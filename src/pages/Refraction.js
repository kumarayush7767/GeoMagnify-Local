                ReMi can be performed under the same layout as used for seismic refraction, to obtain excellent shear
                wave velocity profiles of subsurface. ReMi is a new, proven seismic method for measuring in-situ
                shear-wave (S-wave) velocity profiles. It is economic both in terms of cost and time. Testing is
                performed at the surface using the same conventional seismograph and vertical P-wave geophones used for
                refraction studies. Depending on the material properties of the subsurface, ReMi can determine shear
                wave velocities down to a minimum of 40-100m depth efficiently.
                <br/>
                ReMi is extensively used for following purposes:
                <br/>
                a) Earthquake site response
                <br/>
                b) Shallow Stratigraphy
                <br/>
                c) Liquefaction analysis
                <br/>
                d) Mapping the subsurface and estimating the strength of subsurface materials
                <br/>
                e) Finding buried cultural features, such as dumps and piers
                <br/>
                f) Offshore surveys to determine depth to bedrock for harbour.
                <br/>
                From our experience, we have found MASW to be the best method for cavity detection in Qatar. Electrical
                Resistivity Tomography (ERT) could also be used for cavity detection but it has not been so successful
                in Qatar because of high conductivity of the topsoil. It is also to be noted that the resolution of any
                geophysical technique decreases with depth, i.e., smaller cavity located at shallower depth could be
                identified but cavity of same dimension could not be identified located at deeper levels.
